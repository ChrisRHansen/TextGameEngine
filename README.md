# TextGameEngine

This is a pseudo-3D game engine that draws text characters to screen instead of drawing pixel by pixel. 

It draws the world based on a 2d array of characters that represent the map. Projected rays detect where walls are relative to the player that are then drawn to screen. 
Has the foundation for basic player controlls and combat. The player can move, turn and cast fireballs that will destroy objects in the world when hit. A crude system is in place to enable 
the skeleton enemies to path around the map with A-star pathfinding.
